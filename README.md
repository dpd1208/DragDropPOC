# DragDropPOC

## What is it

Proof of Concept for utilizing draggable.js in a simple express application. Draggable.js is a javascript framework for creating draggable html elements. The framework also supports droppable, sortable, and swappable functionality. More info here: https://shopify.github.io/draggable/

## Challenges

Was not able to get example to run locally. Node would not recognize window objects. Attempted to resolve by installing jsdom but was unsuccessful. Determined that effort spent troubleshooting was not in scope of the project.
